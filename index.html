        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <p>Data Science is the aspect I care most about in the IT world. In the new revolution called 4.0, the world updates trillion databases every day. And the industry of data research was born to discover a great deal of newly updated information. I'm a curious person, so I starve to discover the mystery behind that database, from which to explore the world of Information Technology. Moreover, I am also very interested in the field of Big Data. I always have a question in my mind: How can Facebook run when there are billions of unique users and billions of new data every day? Furthermore, I believe that learning and researching data drives help me get closer to the answer.</a>. For full terms of use of this template please read our <.</p>
        <p>I had contact with computers very early, so I also heard about Information Technology more first. But to say when my passion for IT started, I'll tell you a story. When I was a high school student, I didn't update my knowledge of information technology in general and information security in particular because of my classwork. I lost my Facebook account because of not completing account security. The hacker used my account to chat and borrowed money from my friends and relatives. Fortunately, my ex-boyfriend in high school was a specialized student in informatics. He helped me recover my account after only 5 minutes of being hacked. But unluckily, this hacker had stolen 500 thousand Vietnamese dongs from my mother.
 
	  <p>
Then I began to consider that I lacked IT knowledge; therefore, I followed and read more technical articles. Day by day, I started to comprehend more about IT aspects. And I found that I gradually became passionate about information technology.
I don't have too much experience in information technology. I attended a Data Science course on edX because of my passion for data. I have learned some fundamental things about Numpy and Pandas to process raw data into data for analysis.
	</p>
	  <h6> Why RMIT?</h6>
	  <p>Currently, information technology has been taught at many schools in Vietnam and the world. Thus students have many options for themselves. There are several goals for me to choose RMIT. However, there are three main reasons why RMIT becomes my only and last choice: Quality of training, International environment, Employment opportunities.</p>
	  <p>1. Quality of training:
</p>
	  <p>According to QS world university rankings, "RMIT is in the top 1% of global universities," and RMIT achieved 5 QS stars for the quality of higher education. So I believe in the state of RMIT training in general and the information technology course in particular. Typically the name of the university RMIT stands for the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. That executes me to believe that RMIT will be the most suitable place to provide me background knowledge on the road to determine the technology era.</p>
	  <p>2. International environment:</p>
	  <p>Knowing that studying at RMIT will experience an internationalized environment makes me feel excited and curious. From elementary school to high school, I have never studied in an English-only context. So when I heard about RMIT, I was a bit worried because my English skills were not excellent. But after understanding the skills that an international learning environment offers, it motivates me to enhance my English skills to qualify for RMIT students. Besides, the information technology industry has many English associations, so RMIT is still the best choice for me to practice.
</p>
	  <p>3. Employment opportunities:</p>
	  <p>Students not only graduate with a decree assigned by RMIT University in Melbourne, but the university has supported them since they were third-year students. On RMIT's Fanpage, Career Day also allows students to have many intern opportunities at large corporations. Besides, the website of RMIT Vietnam also mentioned: "The IT Bachelor Program is accredited by the Australian Computer Association (ACS). The Australian Computer Association (ACS) under the Seoul Agreement, is responsible for evaluating and certifying advanced computer or IT training programs from around the world.”. That means that when graduates of information technology at RMIT Vietnam, students can apply to foreign companies to experience the international working environment.</p>
	  <p>4. Expectation</p>
	  <p>My expectations in this course are to focus on clearly knowing IT's aspects definition and the study path. In the IT world, there are many fields divided into roles and programming languages such as website developers, game developers, data science, machine learning.  A deeper understanding of concepts and the skills to work in those fields will support learners easily selecting their preferred and most proper area for themselves. When I notice the education pathway, I want to discuss an example to make my point clearer. For instance, I have identified my favorite area of ​​website developers. I want to know what language I should inquire, which courses I should take, and what skills to learn most effectively.</p>

		  <p><h2>Ideal Job</h2></p>
        <h6>The job advertisement itself.</h6>
        <p>Agoda Data Scientists work independently or in teams to optimize what resources Agoda has and will have: Data. Their job is to design, program, and test algorithms to deliver the most beneficial user experience. Besides, they also support Agoda research, anticipate the demands of the market and customers, pricing products, and the capabilities that the company can advance to compete with competitors. Big data of millions of customers and more than 600 million daily users will be exploited and examined by DS (Data Scientist) to gain a difference, both advanced and innovative. Moreover, they also cooperate and communicate with developers and various business people to accommodate them to answer forecasts about prices and transactions.<br>
More importantly, the DS will be a member of the team of Data Science and Machine Learning to conquer challenges such as ranking search outcomes, intimate accommodations, primarily, unorganized data such as pictures and documents. Generate recommendations for users, create high-level algorithms to advertise products, limit promotion costs, marketing, discover, and query the big data that Agoda collects. The most important responsibility of the Data Scientist position is to serve Agoda "read" customers' thoughts and desires to build a faster search and more productive user experience and avoid fraudulent activities. According to Agoda: "Data is interesting only when you have enough of it, and we have plenty."</br>
</p>
	<h6>What makes this position appeals to me.</h6>
	<p>There are four central reasons why I  fascinated in the position of Data Scientist at Agoda: the nature of the Data Science's job, innovative and multicultural working conditions, equality in recruitment and opportunities, potential to acquire more extensive fields<br>
<p>1. The nature of a Data Scientist’s work:</p>
A DS continuously works alongside data and lots of data. It's not just about collecting, aggregating, but also querying, analyzing, and developing, exploring the insights of that data. And that makes me feel very curious and excited. I appreciate such a creative and exciting job. Besides, a DS also faces many challenges and pressure at work. The sentiment of overcoming difficulties and arduous to achieve an outstanding result then observe the achievements. It makes me love this job even more. And above all, my passion for data is enormous; my desire to explore the mysteries behind it pushes me to search and learn more. That's the reason why I crave to be a Data Scientist.<br>
<p>2. Innovative and multicultural working conditions:</p>
As mentioned by Agodans, they are a group from more than 70 countries, technically imaginative abilities selected from multiple parts of the world. And they have contemporary technology to associate tourists with more than 2.5 million apartments across the globe. If I became an Agoda's graft, I had several opportunities to concede other countries' cultures and get acquainted with and interact with diverse colleagues from multiple parts of the world. Overall, we can build and deploy community connections from which we learn from each other and collaborate more effectively.<br>
As mentioned, becoming a DS means having to confront millions of structured and unstructured data. To be more serviceable for the job, Agoda has introduced the following: "To tackle these challenges, you will have the opportunity to work on one of the world's most massive ML infrastructure employing dozens of GPUs working in parallel, 30K + CPU cores and 150T of memory. " Therefore, the opportunity to access the practical information provided by the data will be significantly assisted by Agoda's Technology.<br>

<p>3. Equality in recruitment and opportunity:</p>
One of the impressions when reading the Agoda recruitment post is the "Equal Opportunity Employer" section at the end of the article. Most of the job postings I've seen rarely mentioned this, although it's essential. Agoda emphasizes fair competition in recruitment, focusing on talent, personal values, qualifications, and the ability to communicate. Notwithstanding your nationality, color, gender, relationship status, tranquility or disability, rural or urban, etc. You have similar opportunities to be received. It also reveals that Agoda's working environment is more critical in terms of ability and capacity to connect with colleagues than situations and high positions. That will constitute an excellent motivation for Agoda staff to develop creatively and breakthroughs in projects.<br>
<p>4. Potential to acquire more extensive fields:</p>
Because working in a DS position at Agoda not only cooperates with colleagues in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, but also Business people. Thanks to that opportunity to socialize with many people working in varied areas such as import and export, logistics, restaurants, hotels, and homestays. I will personally approach and acquire more sources of knowledge in diverse fields. It is a stepping stone for Data scientists to "read" any data from a wide range of domains. Working in a multicultural, multinational environment at Agoda, we learn how to communicate and behave with many other employees and associates. From there, it is possible to gain some knowledge related to the cultural traditions of many countries around the world.

Business people can then understand the insight of the data that Data Scientist provides, thereby making decisions for the business project.</p>
				<p><b> Statistics: </b>Reading statistics well is a strong point of a Data Scientist. Mastery with charts, lines, percentages, and columns will be an essential skill to produce the final results for data outlines.</p>
				<p><b>Data Wrangling:</b> Because Agoda is a hotel booking company, they will have a lot of data errors about location, time, date. Being proficient in quarrel skills of those invalid data will mainly help DS to collect useful information</p>
				<p><b>Data Intuition:</b>  In the job posting, Agoda mentioned that they want DS to help them resolve the problem and give Agoda customers a faster and more accurate search experience. That is also the whole article Data Scientist must find solutions, methods, and issues that need to be solved.</p>
				<u><i>b. The soft skills:  </i></u>
				<p><b>Communication skill:</b>I have read a lot of books on communication skills in life and at work like 'How to Win Friends'</p>
				<p><b>Teamwork and Collaboration skills:</b>  Studied at RMIT University, teamwork skills are the best-honed skills. Besides, becoming a member of RMIT's club has encouraged me to have more chances to work in groups.</p>
				<p><b>Presentation:</b> Like cooperation skills, presentation skills play an essential role. So from high school, I had many opportunities to practice this skill. And when I became a member of RMIT, it also had lots of chances to give presentations in English.</p>

</p>
        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
		  <h6>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h6>
        <p>1. MBTI Personality Test:</p>
		  <img src="images/demo/1.png" alt="">
        <p>According to the test, My personality with high extrovert points means that I often believe outside activities and entertainment are motivations. I am often stimulated by my surroundings and always looking for opportunities to engage with others. I am also regularly very active, energetic, like to communicate, distribute, and assert myself. <br>
Observant is also one of the points the test talks about me. The valid observation here means that I  identify someone who has changed or followed their precepts. I can quickly realize when a person changes his clothes or hairstyle and sometimes his attitude.<br>
Thinking is my style. Focus on objective reality and logical reasoning rather than action by emotions. I often do not permit my feelings to dominate while working and studying.<br>
Judging and evaluating characters and the surrounding events are not naturally attainable. I had to interact with many people, observe them, read their thinking, and take action to make a partial comment on their aspect.<br>
I have to declare my personality very assertively. Especially in matters related to the way of study or work, I always want to be the one who gives the final decision and is responsible for it. I often feel self-assured myself and decisions, and refuse to worry too much about everything around me. And I am also an easy-going and quite stubborn person with my choices.
</p>
		  <p>2. Learning Style Test:</p>
		  <img src="images/demo/2.png" alt="">
		  <p>According to the test, I am a person with a style of learning by hearing. That is, the knowledge and information I listen to I will be able to absorb and remember longer. Besides, the noises and clamor sequentially make me disturbing while thinking. I tend to read out loud when studying or reading a complicated document. This education style has been primarily influenced since I was a child. In Vietnam, elementary students are often taught in this way. The test also provides fantastic suggestions for me to acquire knowledge: <br>
. Find a proper, quiet place to study. <br>
. Record what you learn and listen repeatedly. <br>
. Read the questions and answers out loud<br>
. Should listen to sound, suitable music at school: relax music, baroque music.
</p>
		  <p> 3.  Big Five Personality Test:</p>
		  <img src="images/demo/3.png" alt="",width="200", height="300">
		  <p>Willingness to experience, adventure, curiosity is the representative characteristics that the test talks about myself. I have an imagined thought, the ability to apply knowledge, skills, and a great experience. Easy to acquire both academic and cultural awareness.<br>
Out of 5 Personality, I am most appreciated about conscientiousness (73%). People with this element are usually disciplined, work as organized, and orderly. I always have intentions that come with plans to conquer them. I always finish my assigned job expertly and avoid spontaneous actions and words.<br>
Sometimes I'm also agreeable with empathy. I often attend to other people's stories and help them in my ability. If I had to choose between trust and doubt, I would prefer to trust. Because actually, trusting someone will make you feel better than being wary and suspicious. Moreover, believing in someone's capacity will supply them great motivation to accomplish goals and work.
</p>
		  <h6>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h6>
		  <p><b>Good Side:</b></p>
		  <p>. I will be tolerant, cheerful, and attentive to the other members of the team. Sometimes I will be a binder for other friends to be complacent and perform excellently.<br>
. Observing, paying attention, and regarding others is also a high score when doing teamwork. From there, I can arrange the tasks and assignments for the members appropriately.<br>
. My goals and orientations also are practical and logical. I will be the one who does not allow my sentiments to affect my teamwork progress negatively.<br>
. Because of being a decisive person in decisions, I am always assured and believe in the set goals. From there, I can transfer positive energy to the members of the group. So everyone in my team can trust in their ability and confidently execute the project.<br>
. As an effective learner by hearing, I tend to listen and synthesize various sources' opinions before making a final decision. That's a plus point when working in groups; most people prefer to be heard rather than listen to others. Besides, because I can acquire better knowledge when hearing, I understand the implemented ideas of teammates.<br>
. When working in a group, because you are highly disciplined, I always remind my team to complete the lesson early to request feedback and consult aimed to improve our score. I will create many appointments for our team to operate together. If you're on the same side with me, you're not afraid of being delayed.
</p>
		  <p><b>My Weakness:</b></p>
		  <p> . I am very stubborn in my intentions and goals. To change my thinking, the teammates must make rational analysis, evidence. So sometimes it takes a little time to exchange and negotiate.<br>
. There are troubles from my straightforward suggestions. Because I want everything to be the most beneficial, my teammates will appear pressured and surprised by the opposing opinions from me in the process of working. I'm also learning how to express my views objectively, not to make teammates feel uncomfortable.<br>
. And above all, I am the one who learns by listening, so it will not be accessible if everyone is quiet in my team.<br>
. As an easy-to-trust person, it can sometimes be frustrating if one of my teammates doesn't keep their promises or perform as well as my expectation.
</p>
		  <h6>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h6>
		  <p>With these strengths and weaknesses, I hope my teammate can be hard-working, diligent, and willful. They will be people with similar intentions and goals. They know how to express their emotions and personal beliefs while solving problems instead of giving up. Honesty and integrity are also a character that I hope from my teammates.<br>
After all, no matter what results I want after this project, teammates and I can work together in the future. Besides being a colleague in learning, we also become close friends in society.
</p>
		<p><h2>PROJECT IDEA</h2></p>
			<h6>What are you passionate about?</h6>
				<p>According to my thought, learning is a way to guide the future. Especially in the digital age, the fourth industrial revolution, Information Technology has converted a part of life. In order not to be left behind in a new age, people need to equip themselves with new knowledge related to modern technology. Regularly updating news, current affairs, technology newspapers, mass media is a suitable method for that. And above all, programming is no longer a job, but it has become a must-have skill. Further analysis, everything we encounter daily, is often pre-programmed as handheld computers, laptops, smartphones, video games, online shopping channels, social networks. Programming languages ​​will soon become as common as English (everyone should equip). <br>

				But there are a few issues because programming has hundreds of languages ​​for beginners to get a little complicated and confusing. Moreover, there are not many resources related to information technology and programming languages ​​in Vietnamese or bilingual words. Finally, I desire to help people discover and learn about programming more efficiently, especially for beginners by making a website to share knowlegde about IT. I also wish to connect the community of programmers to build a network of sharing experiences and knowledge in many aspects of technology.
</p>
		<h6>What project will help you develop the skills, experience, and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?</h6>
				<p>This project will first help me find friends and associates with people who have the same passion and goals for working together and exchanging with each other in many future projects. Next, I can practice my communication skills and express my objective opinions through ideas, negotiating to select, and conducting projects. I will have experience in organizing a project and planning to implement it, which is the factor that helps me get closer to the ideal job.<br>
				I have been trained more in programming, research, and writing skills. Besides, sharing my experience with others will help me have more relationships, and that knowledge will be kept longer in my mind.
				</p>
		<h6>My Project Idea</h6>
			<p>1. Overview</p>
				<p>My project will be a website where visitors can take online courses in two languages (English and Vietnamese) in several programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML,... Besides, I will also have categories and areas for those who intend to work on IT. For a long term website development, I want to create a network to connect many other developers. They will share their learning experiences and work in different fields. From there, people, all ages, working or attending school, can easily access the website and equip themselves with the desired knowledge.
</p>
			<p>2. Motivation:</p>
				<p>According to my search, currently, there are not many websites that teach programming, especially bilingual. It usually forces users to pay, and the price is quite high. Most of the new materials are now in English. And consequently, it will be quite tricky for people who do not have much knowledge of information technology. My motivation is to create a place that provides users with programming knowledge and technical English words. There is also an additional exercise to test our understanding after each lesson. And a greater motivation comes from the passion for data distribution and community connection.
</p>
			<p> 3. Description: </p>
				<p>First I would like to introduce the name of the website: 4tech. The name implies the four main features that the website gives users: Academic, Sharing, News, Credits, and Qualifications.<br>
4tech aspires to develop into a distribution that enjoyers not only entry to hit the books but also a diverse channel of instruction supporting you in your performance and maps.
</p>
				<p><u><i>a. Academic:</i></u></p>
						<p>The academic part will be invested in developing the most. Many lectures will be uploaded and updated every time, and users will have the opportunity to experience learning and practice through the exercises of 4tech. Accompanying the talks is a detailed video tutorial. Scholars also have a generalized specialized English vocabulary used in the lesson.<br>
. Lectures: Lectures of many programming languages ​​such as Python, Java, C, C ++, C #.<br>
. Exercise: After each new lesson, there is a practical exercise for students to test their knowledge.<br>
. Videos: Often, academic websites are instructed by the document but rarely have detailed instructional videos. When visiting those sites, beginners will feel a bit overwhelmed. Therefore the lecture with the video will be an excellent solution.<br>
. Vocabulary: The noted vocabulary is usually technical words; students will encounter these words in many documents or other technical articles.
</p>
				<p><u><i>b. Sharing:</i></u></p>
					<p>There is a separate portfolio of posts sharing knowledge and experience in learning and working. Those posts are collected from people who have been in the industry before. Some examples include: Sharing work experience at Google, How to conquer Python, Experience in applying for a  technical job, The opportunity of Data Science in the future.<br>
					Also, part of the Sharing page is the Career path. Each direction of working in technology will accompany the learning path and practice. 4tech will summarize in detail that students can undoubtedly determine their way of studies and careers.
					</p>
				<p><u><i>c. News:</i></u></p>
					<p>The website will integrate many articles about technology, AI projects, Robots, which technologies are being researched, and the revolutions that technology yields to life. <br>
There are also many job postings about technology for students to refer to the application requirements and knowledge required.<br>
Without updating a lot of news, our current knowledge would be outdated as well as without identifying the requirements of employers now; our insights will also become incompetent.
</p>
				<p><u><i>d. Credits or Qualifications:</i></u></p>
					<p>4tech will cooperate with several universities such as RMIT University, Havard, MIT, and technology centers to promote the education curriculum and provide some qualifications and loans when students complete the course and pass the competency assessment exam.<br>
Upon completion of the course, students will either test at the end of the course or undertake scientific and technical projects to pass a 4tech degree. It is of admirable assistance when we apply for a job interview or apply for higher-level scholarships.
</p>
				<p>4. Tool and Technology: </p>
						<p><b>Software:</b></p>
						<p> . We can use pre-designed software like Wix to draft. After using some web development tools like Dreamweaver, Visual Studio, to build Font-end and Backend.<br>
. Graphic editing software like Adobe Photoshop, Sketch is used to design posters, avatars, covers.<br>
. Video editing software like Blender, Lightworks, Camtasia for recording, and editing video lectures.
</p>
						<p><b>Hardware:</b></p>
						<p>. Computer or PC running Windows, Linux, macOS operating systems have proper storage and running speed<br>
. Camera with the excellent recording quality and recording tools included.<br>
. Photos and videos accompany each detailed lecture.<br>
. High and stable Internet speed for running programs and checking.

</p>
						<P><B>Other: </B> Exclusive lesson plans and curriculum.</P>

				<p>5. Skills Required:</p>
						<p><b>Core skils: </b></p>
							<p>. The ability to execute some programming languages for building websites: Front-end( HTML, CSS, JavaScripts,..); Back-end( Java, PHP, Python, Ruby,...)<br>
. Knowing creating videos, an expert in editing it for making subtitles and recording the Screen.<br>
. The capability to design or use some tools to design simple.
</p>
						<p><b>Soft skils: </b></p>
						<p>. The prerequisite is to be responsible for your work.<br>
. Listen and share personal thoughts and opinions objectively when working in groups.<br>
. Perseverance, pursue the project even if there are challenges in the implementation process.<br>
. Unite, even though there are unexpected internal problems in the process. We must also analyze and solve them together.
</p>

				<p>6. Outcome:</p>
        
<p> When 4tech is born, it will resolve difficulties that turned people into academic knowledge and technology-related news. Because of the era of technological innovation, if not equip themselves with new knowledge, people in the whole country, in general, will be left in the global development race.4tech will be a weapon to help people confidently fight in the technology war and create a stepping stone to change the awareness of the majority's information technology. People will no longer feel ambiguous and have difficulty in learning programming like before. Vietnam will come closer to the technological extension of the world.
